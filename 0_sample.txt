"To be, or not to be"
"All the world's a stage"
"Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them."
"What's past is prologue"
"All that glitters is not gold"
"The lady doth protest too much, methinks"
"What a piece of work is a man"
"The quality of mercy"
"The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones."
"What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet."
